### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- `{border-radius: 2px}` property can not be apllied to the `<img>` tags.
- `{text-align: center}` property works fine with flex items.
- Lobotomized owl selector works with flex items. 

### Continued development

- Use more flex property options in the future projects in order to practice flexbox concepts and memorize them.

### Useful resources

- [CSS rounded corners on an image problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6856711/css-rounded-corners-on-an-image-problem) - this helped me to understand why I can not receive rounded corners with `<img>` tag
